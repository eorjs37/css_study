                        <dd>This banana looks a lot like a bird, doesn't it? When originally posted there was some debate whether it was a hummingbird, a seagull, or a crow. I stand by my earlier statement that it is a banana.

                            Boller - or sweet wheat buns - is a favored snack and comfort food for Norwegians, especially enjoyed for childrens' birthdays or on a cold and rainy/snowy day coupled with hot cocoa.

                        <dd>
                            One of the key ingredients of boller is cardamom - something that gives them a distinct aroma and gives them the more lengthy name "cardamom boller".

                            Oh yes: Sometimes when you bake boller, you put a piece of chocolate (usually dark) in the center before baking. That way when an unsuspecting recipient bites into the baked deliciousness they get a sweet surprise.
